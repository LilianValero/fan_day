Flamini looks worse than Arteta in fast paced games IMO, he was poor yesterday and against City earlier on this season both in end to end games. Arteta does a better job than Flamini at stopping the counter too, Flamini seemed to stop doing this after his yellow yesterday. I'd start Flamini against Bayern because they'd probably have more of the ball and he has a better engine."

Yep, title winning form!<br /><br />Spurs will be super motivated for this and I bet they're going to treat it like a Cup Final. It's their Cup Final basically. I'm not Nostradamus but I don't fancy us here. We're in a bad run in the League, and Spurs would want a response after their jobbing at the Bridge."

We need to win this to keep our title hopes alive - we have to win virtually all our remaining games if we're to have any hopes of doing so and this game is no exception. This season, Tottenham have been outscored 23-2 on aggregate by teams in the top 4, we need to put them to the sword. <br /><br />If we score first, expect their crowd to turn on them and become volatile - despite all the humiliating losses they've suffered this year, defeat at the hands of us would be the most painful of all.

Cleverley MKII.[/quote]<br /><br />I completely understand your feelings mate. Arteta is a fantastic team man, is a tidy passer but he is not an out and out holding player. He has clearly been on a downhill slide this season. His legs have deserted him which has led to him being exposed time and again. this problem gets compounded in a league like the Premier league which requires a lot of running and tracking. He has clearly past his best and is getting picked more on past reputation than on current form and fitness. I agree with you in that he is clearly not starter quality.  I just hope and pray the club does not extend his contract as he is a near liability when the tempo hots up. Yesterdays game was a classic example where all he did was sit back without making any effort to close in or tackle and despite that he has got such high ratings its ludicrous. As i have said our expectations have gone so low these days that on account of us constantly underachieving in the last 8-9 years."

Cleverley MKII.[/quote]<br /><br />You are not alone in being disappointed with arteta this season.  <br /><br />I feel he has regressed a lot this season and has had many more poor games than good pr excellent ones.<br /><br />I dont mind being proven wrong eithers via certain stats, but then stats dont always tell the whole truth.<br /><br />A player could make 99 out of 100 passes in a game, but the 1 stray pass could lead to the goal that lost you points instead of getting all 3.  Looking at those stats, you wouldnt know.<br /><br />For me, Arteta needs to be replaced in the summer with a player we actually needed last summer.  A disciplined brute that can pick the occassional pass forward.<br /><br />His engine, acceleration and recovery speed is an increasing concern to me and it needs to be addressed as a priority after a striker."

Spurs because they are not confident and we because we usually adapt to the pace our opponents play at. Even though Im not a fan of Podolski I would really play him cazorla and Chamberlain from start for this one......knowing Wenger it will be rosicky and cazorla and chamberlain which means the approach will be more about containing them than having a go at them. As bad as Spurs are, I wouldnt be one bit surprised if they bear us. We are a good team to play when you have no confidence. Its one thing to play against Bayern and keep it close when there is no pressure on you. Its whole different thing to go to stoke away and win when people expect you or beat an off form Spurs when people expect you to do so. This is why the Bayern draw means nothing......This is the game it really matters and I know Arsenal well enough to know what to expect"

When they don't, they are not that good. When you put them under pressure, they can't handle it.<br /><br />\"They don't have a lot of physical presence. Apart from Flamini, I don't see anyone who puts themselves into a proper battle.<br /><br />\"Rosicky is not that type of player, Cazorla is not the type of player who defends. Arteta is trying to do it, but that's not his job.<br /><br />\"They don't have anybody who can say, 'if I have to kick, I will kick. If we have to fight, I will put myself at the front of it'. That's how we have to play. Push them and force them to make errors.\"<br /><br />The character of some of Tottenham's own players has been called into question by boss Tim Sherwood after a couple of demoralising defeats this week, with a 4-0 drubbing at Chelsea followed by a 3-1 loss at home to Benfica in the Europa League.<br /><br />Adebayor accepts that Spurs have not shown enough hunger in certain games, but says there will be no problem with motivation on Sunday.<br /><br />He said: \"In some games, some players, including me - I have to include myself - we have lacked that personality. We have lacked that desire and things have gone wrong.<br /><br />\"That's why we have to look into the mirror and say, 'OK, I judge myself, I didn't play well today, but in the next game I will be better'.<br /><br />\"On Sunday I don't even think we will need a team meeting.<br /><br />\"There are some games where you have to give a little bit of motivation to the players. But we know how good we are at home when it comes to Arsenal and we won't have to motivate anybody for this game.\"<br /><br />Adebayor added: \"The is the game that everybody will be talking about in London from this point,\" said the striker, \"Tottenham v Arsenal: The north London derby.<br /><br />\"So I cannot see anybody telling me, 'Manu, you have to run. You have to give 100 per cent'.<br /><br />\"No one will need to tell me that. I know. And people like Aaron Lennon, who has been here for ages, you won't have to tell players like him anything either. He knows how big it is for the club and the fans. To be honest with you, we are all looking forward to it.\"[/quote]<br /><br />Source: [url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11670/9214573/tottenhams-emmanuel-adebayor-says-pressure-gets-to-arsenal-ahead-of-north-london-derby]http://www1.skysports.com/football/news ... ndon-derby[/url]"

        "content": "Outstanding result. Super chuffed with the result but some of our players need to take a long hard look at themselves. Koscielny and Mertesacker bailed us out with countless clearances and interceptions. I don't care how we got the result but it was a pretty poor display in terms of keeping possession and doing simple things. We had major issues keeping hold of the ball in our own half. it was good that Chadli was playing as our undercover agent. Adebayor had a brilliant game for them but he too fluffed a couple of chances. Wenger should have adopted a more measured approach by brining in Flamini at half time. Spurs were all over us in the second half. Wenger's reluctance to ring in changes in a proactive manner is really irritating. Happy to see Spurs being relegated to play Europa league yet again. not too positive about our title chances especially with the kind of performance put in today. Nice to see us ensure Wenger trophy for yet another season."

Chadli missed a couple of great chances also made some poor decisions in the final third. Adebayor the same. They could have scored a couple on another day too. We  had no organization in the middle of the park. We made nearly 60 clearances inside the box. Yes as i said before the game i don't care how we won but that does not mean with better finishing it would have been a convincing win. With better finishing on their end they could have scored at-least as much as we did."
