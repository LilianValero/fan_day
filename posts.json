Flamini looks worse than Arteta in fast paced games IMO, he was poor yesterday and against City earlier on this season both in end to end games. Arteta does a better job than Flamini at stopping the counter too, Flamini seemed to stop doing this after his yellow yesterday. I'd start Flamini against Bayern because they'd probably have more of the ball and he has a better engine."

Yep, title winning form!<br /><br />Spurs will be super motivated for this and I bet they're going to treat it like a Cup Final. It's their Cup Final basically. I'm not Nostradamus but I don't fancy us here. We're in a bad run in the League, and Spurs would want a response after their jobbing at the Bridge."

We need to win this to keep our title hopes alive - we have to win virtually all our remaining games if we're to have any hopes of doing so and this game is no exception. This season, Tottenham have been outscored 23-2 on aggregate by teams in the top 4, we need to put them to the sword. <br /><br />If we score first, expect their crowd to turn on them and become volatile - despite all the humiliating losses they've suffered this year, defeat at the hands of us would be the most painful of all.

Cleverley MKII.[/quote]<br /><br />I completely understand your feelings mate. Arteta is a fantastic team man, is a tidy passer but he is not an out and out holding player. He has clearly been on a downhill slide this season. His legs have deserted him which has led to him being exposed time and again. this problem gets compounded in a league like the Premier league which requires a lot of running and tracking. He has clearly past his best and is getting picked more on past reputation than on current form and fitness. I agree with you in that he is clearly not starter quality.  I just hope and pray the club does not extend his contract as he is a near liability when the tempo hots up. Yesterdays game was a classic example where all he did was sit back without making any effort to close in or tackle and despite that he has got such high ratings its ludicrous. As i have said our expectations have gone so low these days that on account of us constantly underachieving in the last 8-9 years."

Cleverley MKII.[/quote]<br /><br />You are not alone in being disappointed with arteta this season.  <br /><br />I feel he has regressed a lot this season and has had many more poor games than good pr excellent ones.<br /><br />I dont mind being proven wrong eithers via certain stats, but then stats dont always tell the whole truth.<br /><br />A player could make 99 out of 100 passes in a game, but the 1 stray pass could lead to the goal that lost you points instead of getting all 3.  Looking at those stats, you wouldnt know.<br /><br />For me, Arteta needs to be replaced in the summer with a player we actually needed last summer.  A disciplined brute that can pick the occassional pass forward.<br /><br />His engine, acceleration and recovery speed is an increasing concern to me and it needs to be addressed as a priority after a striker."

This will be the 254th time the two teams have met.<br />\n<br />\nSpurs v Arsenal is now one of the great rivalries in World Football but the fixture had very different beginnings back in November 1887 when the clubs first met in a friendly played on Tottenham Marshes. Arsenal, then called Royal Arsenal, had been formed just a year earlier as Dial Square and were essentially the works team for the munitions factory situated in Woolwich, Kent, while Spurs who had been formed some five years earlier in 1882 still had many of the youngsters who founded the club playing for them. Spurs won that first encounter 2-1, although the game was cut short by 15 minutes, due to poor light conditions because of the Arsenal team getting lost and turning-up late for the start.<br />\n<br />\nSeven more friendlies were played between the two clubs from 1888 to 1896 with Spurs winning four and Arsenal winning three before their first competitive match in March 1899. By this time, Arsenal were re-named Woolwich Arsenal and the clubs met in the United League with the Gunners winning 2-1 at the Manor Ground in Plumstead while Spurs won the return match 3-2 at Northumberland Park.<br />\n<br />\nTwo matches were played within the same week in April 1900 in the Southern District Combination League with Spurs winning 4-2 at White Hart Lane which was followed by a 2-1 win to Arsenal at Plumstead in a game abandoned after 75 minutes due to &quot;bad language&quot;. History doesn't provide the answer as to who was the guilty party! From 1901 to 1920, the clubs met in various minor competitions, friendlies and matches played during the First World War.<br />\n<br />\nTottenham Hotspur joined the Football League in season 1908-09 and won promotion to the First Division on their first attempt. The following season they played Arsenal in December 1909 and lost 0-1 at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, while the reverse fixture at White Hart Lane ended in a 1-1 draw with John Curtis scoring Spurs' first League goal against the Gunners.<br />\n<br />\nThe teams met for three more seasons before Arsenal's relegation at the end of the 1912-13 season with Spurs winning three matches, Arsenal winning two and one game drawn.<br />\n<br />\nSeptember 1913 proved to be a hugely important date in the history of both clubs as Arsenal controversially moved from south of the River Thames into the territory reserved for Tottenham Hotspur and Clapton (later Leyton) Orient, in clear violation of the rules and regulations governing such relocations as stipulated by the Football League. Despite bitter protests, Arsenal's move to Highbury (more correctly called Arsenal Stadium) was allowed.<br />\n<br />\nWhite Hart Lane was requisitioned by the Army during WWI, so Spurs played many of their wartime matches at Highbury.<br />\n<br />\nWhen League football resumed after the war in 1919, it was decided to once again expand the First Division from 20 teams to 22. The normal way of doing this had always been to add the top two clubs from the Second Division to those who were already in the First Division. However, there were complications arising from allegations of match-fixing from Liverpool and Manchester United during the final matches of the last season played before the League was suspended and it was felt that they would forfit their Top Flight status as a result.<br />\n<br />\nFrom nowhere, Arsenal, who had finished sixth (later corrected to fifth) in the Second Division before the war were 'elected' to take Tottenham Hotspur's place in the First Division. Allegations of bribery persist to this day and Henry Norris (Arsenal's Chairman) was later given a lifetime ban from football from the Football League for underhand financial activities.<br />\n<br />\nSpurs and Arsenal played their first Football League match after World War One in the First Division in January 1921 with Spurs winning 2-1 at White Hart Lane while Arsenal won the return match at Highbury 3-2. All 150 League games played to date have taken place in the Top Flight of English football.<br />\n<br />\nHighbury was taken over by the Army during the Second World War and Spurs returned the favour by allowing Arsenal to play their wartime matches at White Hart Lane. Arsenal won the first FA Cup meeting between the two teams 3-0 in the 3rd Round in January 1949. The clubs have played five FA Cup matches to date with Spurs winning two and Arsenal winning three.<br />\n<br />\nThe first Football League Cup match took place in November 1968 with Arsenal winning the first leg of the Semi-Final 1-0 at Highbury and Spurs drawing 1-1 at White Hart Lane the following month. Of the 12 League Cup matches played so far, Spurs have won 3, Arsenal have won 6 and three games have been drawn.<br />\n<br />\nBoth Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur were founder members of the Premier League in season 1992-93 and both clubs are among the seven (Liverpool, Everton, Chelsea, Manchester United and Aston Villa are the other five) who have been ever-present during the 21 seasons of the competition.<br />\n<br />\nArsenal went two goals ahead by halftime in the 2010-11 fixture at the Emirates in November through Samir Nasri and Marouane Chamakh but Spurs came back strongly with goals from Gareth Bale, Rafael van der Vaart (penalty) and Younes Kaboul to secure a 3-2 win.<br />\n<br />\nThe match at White Hart Lane in April 2011 was a six goal thriller with honours even. Theo Walcott and Rafael van der Vaart scored goals within the first 10 minutes before Samir Nasri put the Gunners 2-1 up after 12 minutes. Arsenal went further ahead with a Robin van Persie goal on 40 minutes but Tom Huddlestone made it 2-3 by halftime. Van der Vaart scored the only goal in the second half from the penalty spot.<br />\n<br />\nThe fixture at White Hart Lane in October 2011 was won by Spurs 2-1 with goals from Rafael van der Vaart and Kyle Walker with Aaron Ramsey scoring for Arsenal. The Gunners won their home match in February 2012 5-2. Louis Saha had put Spurs ahead after 4 minutes and an Emmanuel Adebayor penalty put Tottenham further ahead after 34 minutes. But Arsenal pulled two goals back before half-time through Bacary Sagna and Robin van Persie. Tomas Rosicky put Arsenal in front just after the break and the rout was completed with a brace from Theo Walcott.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the 2012 summer transfer window, Spurs signed former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor from Manchester City after having spent a season on loan.<br />\n<br />\nThe match on 17th November at the Emirates resulted in a 5-2 win for Arsenal. Emmanuel Adebayor put Spurs ahead after 10 minutes but was sent-off eight minutes later for a rash tackle on Santi Cazorla. Arsenal then scored three times to make it 3-1 at halftime - Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud  grabbing the goals. Santi Cazorla put Arsenal further ahead on the hour mark but Gareth Bale pulled one back for Spurs before Theo Walcott scored the fifth for Arsenal just before the final whistle.<br />\n<br />\nSpurs won the match at the Lane in March 2013 2-1 with Gareth Bale scoring after 37 minutes and Aaron Lennon adding a second two minutes later. Per Mertesacker pulled a goal back for Arsenal six minutes into the second half.<br />\n<br />\nOlivier Giroud scored in the 23rd minute to give Arsenal the points in the September 2013 Premier League game at the Emirates.<br />\n<br />\nArsenal ran-out 2-0 winners in the FA Cup 3rd Round match played at the Emirates in January 2014 with Santi Cazorla &amp; Tomas Rosicky scoring a goal each.<br />\n<br />\nAs far as Football League / Premier League matches go, three player have both scored nine goals for Spurs against Arsenal - Billy Minter and Bobby Smith.<br />\n<br />\nThree Arsenal players have each scored eight goals against Spurs - Robert Pires, Emmanuel Adebayor and Alan Smith.<br />\n<br />\nThere have been three hat-tricks scored during North London Derbies - Terry Dyson for Spurs and Ted Drake &amp; Alan Sunderland for Arsenal.<br />\n<br />\nJimmy Robertson &amp; Emmanuel Adebayor are the only two players to score for both Spurs &amp; Arsenal in a North London Derby.<br />\n<br />\nArsenal's David O'Leary has played in the most North London Derbies (35) while both Gary Mabbutt &amp; Steve Perryman played 31 games with Spurs.<br />\n<br />\nOverall, Spurs have won 91 of the 253 matches played against Arsenal with the Gunners winning 103 and 59 matches drawn.<br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6535_zps5e9efb40.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n<b>[URL=&quot;http://www.myfootballfacts.com/SpursvArsenal.html&quot;]Full History of Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal Matches 1887-2014[/url]</b><br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6537_zps453a29ac.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n<b>They Played for Spurs &amp; Arsenal....</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>Emmanuel Adebayor<br />\nClive Allen</b><br />\nCharlie Ambler<br />\nBob Arber (Arsenal player, Spurs reserves manager)<br />\n<b>David Bentley</b><br />\nDavid Black<br />\n<b>Anton Blackwood</b><br />\nJimmy Brain<br />\n<b>Laurie Brown</b><br />\nWalter Bugg<br />\nLycurgus Burrows<br />\n<b>Sol Campbell</b><br />\nHerbert Chapman (Spurs player, Arsenal manager)<br />\nDamien Comolli (Director of Football at both clubs)<br />\nFreddie Cox<br />\nJames Delvin<br />\nWilf Dixon (Spurs assistant manager, Arsenal trainer)<br />\nJack Eggett<br />\nTom Fitchie<br />\nTheo Foley (Arsenal assistant manager, Spurs reserves manager)<br />\n<b>William Gallas<br />\nGeorge Graham</b> (Arsenal player, manager of both clubs)<br />\n<b>Vic Groves</b><br />\nTom Hatfield<br />\nStewart Houston (Assistant manager at both clubs)<br />\nJoe Hulme (Arsenal player, Spurs manager)<br />\nGeorge Hunt<br />\n<b>David Jenkins<br />\nPat Jennings</b><br />\nBill Julian<br />\nPeter Kyle<br />\nNeil Lacy<br />\nBill Lane (Spurs player, Arsenal scout)<br />\nPeter McWilliam (Spurs manager, Arsenal scout)<br />\nTom Meade<br />\nBilly Minter<br />\n<b>Terry Naylor<br />\nTerry Neill</b> (Arsenal player, manager of both clubs)<br />\n<b>Jamie O'Hara</b><br />\nTom O'Shea<br />\nGeorge Payne<br />\nRon Piper<br />\nTom Pratt<br />\n<b>Rohan Ricketts<br />\nJimmy Robertson</b><br />\nAndrew Swan<br />\nWalter Thomas<br />\nErik Thorstvedt<br />\n<b>Steve Walford</b><br />\nErnie Walley (Spurs player, Arsenal coach)<br />\nCharlie Williams<br />\n<b>Willie Young</b><br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A1805_zpsf0a6bc72.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n<b>[URL=&quot;http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Tottenham_Hotspur_Squad_Numbers.html&quot;]Tottenham Hotspur Premier League Player's Squad Numbers 1993-94 to 2013-14[/url]</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>[URL=&quot;http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Arsenal_Squad_Numbers.html&quot;]Arsenal Premier League Player's Squad Numbers 1993-94 to 2013-14[/url]</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>[URL=&quot;http://www.myfootballfacts.com/London_Derbies_2013-14.html&quot;]Premier League London Derbies Season 2013-14[/url]</b><br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6542_zps5824268a.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6543_zps8c41664b.jpg[/IMG]"

Im sure plenty of people have given up already but if we can somehow muster a victory in this all important game, gain some momentum and some key players back and rediscover the form we had when Sherwood first took over, who knows. Back to back wins against Southampton and Arsenal coupled with back to back loses against us and Chelsea for the gunners, I tell you now, thingsw will start to get very interesting around here. Big ifs but for it all to happen the way we want it to happen we need to beat the scum this weekend.<br />\n<br />\nBoth teams are injury hit but you have got to think we are the slightly better off with arsenal missing wilshere, ramsay,  ozil, walcott and both of their left backs. Say what you want about our form and theirs.....this is the derby, the form book goes out the window and its who wants it the most. Huge stakes to play for for both teams in this one, this game evokes memories of our 2009/10 clash. <br />\n<br />\nWalker and Sandro are both doubts but Ive got to think if there is any chance either will play in this one, they will. No point in looking forward, there will be 2/3rds of fuk all to play for if we come up short.<br />\n<br />\nI just want to see a team sheet before the game that gives me confidence.  Something like this....<br />\n<br />\nLloris<br />\nWalker, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Rose<br />\nSandro<br />\nLennon, Dembele, Eriksen, Townsend<br />\nAdebayor<br />\n<br />\nNo two strikers, Eriksen in a central position,  real wingers, fullbacks playing on their proper sides, no love childs (Bentaleb) and a team of commited footballers who look as though they want to play for the jersey. Please Tim, do us and your job prospects a favour and heed my advice. <br />\n<br />\nTo Dare is to Do!!!<br />\n<br />\nCOYS"

My other current fear is Sandro, since he's been back and especially watching him first hand at Chelsea and last night on TV, he just seems to tear around the pitch mis-timing tackles. If we suffer another sending off in this game I fear an onslaught.<br />\n<br />\nPlease god just win this one, don't care how, who with or how many.[/QUOTE]<br />\n<br />\nSandro is the least of our problems, we need players who can fight. Against Benfica Sandro only got booked because he had no other choice, Eriksen took such a bad free kick that we almost conceded on the break. With a few more minutes his tackling will be back to normal. Most important thing in this game is that we keep a clean sheet, I expect Bentaleb will come in to partner Sandro if Dembele doesn't make it, he was one of our only decent players against Chelsea.<br />\n<br />\nBeing realistic we should accept that there isn't much more these players can do. Some of them are carrying knocks, some of them haven't adjusted to the league, some of them are only just back from lengthy injuries, some missed pre-season, some haven't adapted to the change in manager, there are so many things working against us at the moment. We need to keep working hard with an eye on making a real challenge for the top 4 next season. It's March and we still don't know our best XI, that is the biggest difference between us and the current top 4. We have no idea what our best team is and as a result no real understanding has developed on the pitch."

Spurs because they are not confident and we because we usually adapt to the pace our opponents play at. Even though Im not a fan of Podolski I would really play him cazorla and Chamberlain from start for this one......knowing Wenger it will be rosicky and cazorla and chamberlain which means the approach will be more about containing them than having a go at them. As bad as Spurs are, I wouldnt be one bit surprised if they bear us. We are a good team to play when you have no confidence. Its one thing to play against Bayern and keep it close when there is no pressure on you. Its whole different thing to go to stoke away and win when people expect you or beat an off form Spurs when people expect you to do so. This is why the Bayern draw means nothing......This is the game it really matters and I know Arsenal well enough to know what to expect"

So often you see teams bounce back from a bad loss, but after the Chelsea game we played Benfica  with again a total lack of ideas. Yes Benfica were a class act, but at times our players looked lost, I am dreading the next two matches, because if we let in an early goal I think we will just collapse. I have generally believe there are several players who just cant wait for the season to end, having said that reading several of the posts on here the same could apply to many of the fans.[/QUOTE]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBenfica were a class act? Don't think so mate, they were playing like they didn't give a crap for the better part of that first half. We got undone by basic moves, made key defensive errors for each goal they scored. We make it too easy for teams that has been the issue all season. We didn't look lost at times, we looked lost all game. Honestly we are getting too much credit. We are cack. Complete dog doodoo, testicles, cow teets, whatever you want to call us. Why is this piece of crap squad still 5th? I do not know. I predict our league position wont look so flattering over the next few weeks. I've gotten to the point where I don't even like watching us play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWenger is smart enough to know how vulnerable we are. It'd be as easy as exploiting our many, many weaknesses. This should be an easy win for Arsenal despite their injuries. We basically have to rely on the random factor of NLD's hope it just goes all chaotic and we scrape out on top in the end"

        "content": "[quote]<br /><b>Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor says pressure gets to Arsenal ahead of North London derby<br /></b><br /><br /><b>Emmanuel Adebayor does not believe Arsenal can handle pressure and has called on his Tottenham Hotspur team-mates to take the fight to the Gunners in Sunday's North London derby.</b><br /><br />The capital rivals lock horns at White Hart Lane this weekend in a vital clash for both sides, as Spurs look to keep their top-four hopes alive and Arsenal strive to stay in touch with Premier League leaders Chelsea.<br /><br />Adebayor played for Arsenal for three years and admires the way Arsene Wenger's team play, but believes there are weaknesses that can be exploited due to a lack of tenacious midfielders.<br /><br />He told the Daily Mirror: \"Arsenal are a good team when they have the ball. When they don't, they are not that good. When you put them under pressure, they can't handle it.<br /><br />\"They don't have a lot of physical presence. Apart from Flamini, I don't see anyone who puts themselves into a proper battle.<br /><br />\"Rosicky is not that type of player, Cazorla is not the type of player who defends. Arteta is trying to do it, but that's not his job.<br /><br />\"They don't have anybody who can say, 'if I have to kick, I will kick. If we have to fight, I will put myself at the front of it'. That's how we have to play. Push them and force them to make errors.\"<br /><br />The character of some of Tottenham's own players has been called into question by boss Tim Sherwood after a couple of demoralising defeats this week, with a 4-0 drubbing at Chelsea followed by a 3-1 loss at home to Benfica in the Europa League.<br /><br />Adebayor accepts that Spurs have not shown enough hunger in certain games, but says there will be no problem with motivation on Sunday.<br /><br />He said: \"In some games, some players, including me - I have to include myself - we have lacked that personality. We have lacked that desire and things have gone wrong.<br /><br />\"That's why we have to look into the mirror and say, 'OK, I judge myself, I didn't play well today, but in the next game I will be better'.<br /><br />\"On Sunday I don't even think we will need a team meeting.<br /><br />\"There are some games where you have to give a little bit of motivation to the players. But we know how good we are at home when it comes to Arsenal and we won't have to motivate anybody for this game.\"<br /><br />Adebayor added: \"The is the game that everybody will be talking about in London from this point,\" said the striker, \"Tottenham v Arsenal: The north London derby.<br /><br />\"So I cannot see anybody telling me, 'Manu, you have to run. You have to give 100 per cent'.<br /><br />\"No one will need to tell me that. I know. And people like Aaron Lennon, who has been here for ages, you won't have to tell players like him anything either. He knows how big it is for the club and the fans. To be honest with you, we are all looking forward to it.\"[/quote]<br /><br />Source: [url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11670/9214573/tottenhams-emmanuel-adebayor-says-pressure-gets-to-arsenal-ahead-of-north-london-derby]http://www1.skysports.com/football/news ... ndon-derby[/url]"

He also hasn't been that effective in the last few games. Soldado needs to play a few times with a line-up that can deliver the right type of service to make him effective. We can't keep limping along with a single striker, who may, or may not decide to turn up, or may get himself a red card during the match. We also need to know (for sure) whether we are going to keep, or replace Soldado, come the summer.<br />\n<br />\nThere is an argument that if we can't win the EL and we can't get 5th or better, that we should use the remaining matches to try and prepare ourselves for next season.

        "content": "[QUOTE][url=http://www.tottenhamhotspurs.tv/forum/showthread.php?p=950423]Originally Posted by fuego[/url]<br />\nThe reason I didn't pick Adebayor is because I believe he is too high risk in a game against Arsenal. He also hasn't been that effective in the last few games. Soldado needs to play a few times with a line-up that can deliver the right type of service to make him effective. We can't keep limping along with a single striker, who may, or may not decide to turn up, or may get himself a red card during the match. We also need to know (for sure) whether we are going to keep, or replace Soldado, come the summer.<br />\n<br />\nThere is an argument that if we can't win the EL and we can't get 5th or better, that we should use the remaining matches to try and prepare ourselves for next season. I.e. as a means to finding solutions for our current issues. Maybe it's still too early to do so. By next weekend, however, we should know for sure.[/QUOTE]<br />\n<br />\nI understand your worries about Adebayor especially in this game but I just think that we need to forget about this for today and trust him. If he's on his game he could win this one for us singlehandedly and then afterwards we can starting bedding in Soldado (whom I still have very high hopes for, love the fella)."

        "content": "i agree with bentaleb in the middle. pauli has been poor of late, so next best (with dembele not fit) is bentaleb. Sandro will provide cover, nabil will recycle the ball to eriksen (but add little creativity going forward). i like dropping siggy and lennon. siggy isn't a winger, he plays his best games in the hole and with eriksen there he has no place in the team. chadli will help provide strength in attacking and defending and is more two footed than lennon imo and maybe andros will show what he did in the first couple games of the year. starting soldado with ade up top would have been dumb because we need to own midfield. best way to own the middle of the pitch is to have more players there to win possession back. last time we played arsenal (league cup) we had 2 in the middle and eriksen out wide, we all know how that ended. i think TS got it as right as he could have with the injuries to the squad. <br />\n<br />\nCOYS!!"

Though when fit I think Sandro offers something and can be very useful. However, he's been fit so rarely in his Spurs career. A player needs 10 games to get properly match fit and Sandro is one of those players that struggles to do that. I like the the guy, but if he were to be sold, I'd want us to sign a more technical footballer to replace him. From now on, no matter what their role in the team is, everyone we sign should be comfortable on the ball and be able to pass it around at a high tempo."

There is no point trying to suggest players who are barely match fit like Sando (he ran like he had weights on his ankles in recent weeks) and Kaboul would get anywhere near their team. Maybe if they'd been playing regularly and were at their best, but not even close now. And Verts simply doesn't deserve to be ahead of their CB's. <br />\n<br />\nSo, whilst I agree they are nothing special, I think we need to start accepting how average many of our players are. The bast majority of our side are mid table Prem standard or perhaps lower. Most would struggle to get into Evertons team."

I don't care how we got the result but it was a pretty poor display in terms of keeping possession and doing simple things. We had major issues keeping hold of the ball in our own half. it was good that Chadli was playing as our undercover agent. Adebayor had a brilliant game for them but he too fluffed a couple of chances. Wenger should have adopted a more measured approach by brining in Flamini at half time. Spurs were all over us in the second half. Wenger's reluctance to ring in changes in a proactive manner is really irritating. Happy to see Spurs being relegated to play Europa league yet again. not too positive about our title chances especially with the kind of performance put in today. Nice to see us ensure Wenger trophy for yet another season."

Another disappointing season, very disappointing when you think of the players we've bought in.Credit to the Arse they grabbed a great goal and sat on it, they were able to do that because we were ineffective up front and truth be known it was them more likely to score another as time went on. The season is over for us now and a top half position is what we're looking at. Southampton next I believe and hope to get something then but it's not crucial any more so we'll see. I can only hope the new season brings in a good few new players, a new manager and a different style that's not so easy to counter. I did say we'll get beaten in this match and that's 3 times out of 3 for Arsenal, humiliating but nothing to what Liverpool are going to inflict on us."

As for Sherwood? I thought he did great! We played great stuff and put them under serious pressure. At the end of the day we don't have the players who can unlock a Champions League level defence and the only one who has a hope of even sniffing a goal is Adebayor. This isn't the players fault, this isn't Sherwoods faul, this is Levy and Baldinis fault for buying these players. We need to rebuild in the Summer with players who are quick, strong and can finish.

I think the problem is that his best isn't good enough, either that or half the squad has been beaten with the dumb stick because it isn't really looking like they have a decent plan. So either it's the manager's plan that's lacking or the manager has a fan-oh-tastic plan that the players aren't managing to put to life. We are not scoring goals, and we're generally hardly creating clear cut chances or sometimes we even struggle to string three passes together against mediocre opposition. I mean our goal difference is pathetic and while it's been a tad better under Tim it's still pretty awful and we're about as entertaining to look at as rain.<br />\n<br />\nToday we at least played well and it's nearly a miracle that we didn't get two-three goals, and yet another miracle that we only conceded once.

Rose did well on the other side in the first half, but final ball is terrible. The high line was suicidal with no pressure for opening half hour but with an increase in tempo we saw the benefits of this system as it pinned them back. Unfortunately they kinda put backs to the wall in second half, closing up the space available in the first half and forcing us to use possession effectively, a fault of ours all season. Eriksen didn't really affect the game from the left but to me the subs were pointless. Straight swap Sandro for Pauly I understand. Siggy though has little impact barring goals which he wasnt in a position to get most of the time. Soldado perhaps should have been introduced earlier but not for eriksen, as with a front two and a midfield pairing of Paulinho/Bentaleb we simply couldnt create good chances and ultimately ran out of steam.

        "content": "We obviously played better today. But let's be honest here Arsenal were pretty well missing half there first choice midfield and from what i gathered. Bayern Munich ran them off the park and were buggered when they got back to London. We couldn't even break them down and get a goal at home. That aint good, I didn't think the team selection was that bad today. But seriously this was a must win for us. Arsenal were depleted, we are at home. Why would we not go in with two strikers. Sherwood always said he'd go for it. But he is playing like a man who doesn't want to get thumped.<br />\n<br />\nToday there were countless times we got the ball to the by-line cut it back and their was no one in the box. If Chadli is going to play that number 10 role he has to be more prevalent in the box. I just felt he was dropping too deep and not helping adebayor. Adebayor really needed the help and was just not getting it. The other thing is why Sherwood is making his subs so late. What is the point in making the subs in the 80th minute. Why take off Chadli, Erikson, Sandro and Put on Siggy and Paulinho. We are chasing a game we need creativity. Take off Chadli and put Soldado up front with Ade. If i had missed the subs i would never have known he made three subs, they were truly ineffective and we became very easy to predict. <br />\n<br />\nOn the plus side. I think Naughton had a good game, Defensively i think he's better than Walker on the right. Obviously not quite up there in attack but i think he keeps a level head a bit better than Walker. Rose also did a good job, people keep talking about the final product but who was there to pass to. 1 attacker in the box and 4 defenders. Your just never going to pick out your player. <br />\nTownsend is a funny one, he gets himself into some awesome positions but then almost tries to hard. Some of the balls he crossed just didn't need to be hit that hard. Just pass it to the players fit dont blast it across goal.<br />\n<br />\nI don't really know what to make of Chadli, i think two upfront is just hands down a better option for a team who are struggling so much to put the ball in the net. this 4-3-3 stuff is so heavily reliant on the wingers being absolute class, and having the knowledge to support the striker in the box. Our wingers just dont look threatening in the box. Half the time i'm gobsmacked at how many of spurs players are not making that final run to the far post or just hanging around the top of the box. Like make a ****ing run, take a chance. At the very least it forces one of the defenders to not concentrate soley on ade. <br />\n<br />\nI dunno thats my thoughts, i think pretty well everyone can see after playing over 3 quarters of the season with a 4-3-3. It is not suiting us at home. Maybe away but at home two strikers up front is imperative from the start. <b>And for the sake of my own sanity, when we are behind in a game stop taking off creative players and putting on players who can close out a game. When we are ahead put on defensive players. For me though TS is so far out of his depth it aint funny. </b>I'm all for giving manager's a chance and all. But i think the hallmark of a good manager is their ability to change the game with subs. Can't really remember an effective sub TS has made in 4 months."

That is probably the top priority that needs addressing even ahead of the back 4. I feel a little sorry for the likes of Lennon and Townsend because the CM's are giving them very little to work with.

The first half, Townsend was flat on his feet and second half moved more but only to come closer to have it to feet rather than offer a through ball run.<br />\n<br />\nMajority of our possession is with our centre backs, not because of them not knowing what to do with it, it's them not having any options to do anything with it..

However, he has such little help down the left when Eriksen is there. Eriksen naturally and rightly floats into the centre of the pitch leaving rose to cover two players. Then if Rose pushes up on their right back it means Jan has to come across to the left midfielder exposing a hole in the heart of our defence.<br />\n<br />\nNo fault of the players, the fault lies at not having a natural left winger who fully understands the role rather than a makeshift winger using a central midfielder - something that hasn't been addressed since Bale moved into the CAM role middle of last season.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

        "content": "That game summed up perfectly our current troubles; we had most of the possession, we had most shots on goal and we spent vastly the most amount of time in arse's half. Yet we were impotent. Arse had more shots on target than we did and the clearest chances, despite being on the back foot most of the game and despite missing many good players. We just huffed and puffed without effect for most of the game. We enjoyed a new manager bounce for a bit but that's now evaporated and this could have been a late avb performance.<br />\nWe need even a weakened arse's creativity and we need speed, we're too ploddy and predictable in our approach play and defensively we look likely to concede every time. Ade spend too much time deep coming for the ball or out on the wings and only seems to go upfront when we start playing like Wimbledon and hoofing long balls from the back. Not surprisingly the lads lack confidence which isn't helping but were too predictable. Likely TS will be gone once this forgettable season ends, we need a fresh start with an experienced coach who can take us forward rather than sideways. We need to study the Liverpool model and accept a season or two of building with a PROVEN coach No more cheapskate gambles Mr Levy. Let's get it right next time, no more gambles."

Small victories.[/QUOTE]<br />\n<br />\nPersonally I'd not mind missing out on the EL, doesn't seem to do us much good in the league, a quick glance at our record on Sundays following Thursday games is quite scary. Missing out hasn't done Liverpool much harm. Besides we haven't a hope in hell of winning it with the current format of UCL drop-outs."

        "content": "[QUOTE][url=http://www.tottenhamhotspurs.tv/forum/showthread.php?p=951143]Originally Posted by gauntarchie[/url]<br />\nWe obviously played better today. But let's be honest here Arsenal were pretty well missing half there first choice midfield and from what i gathered. Bayern Munich ran them off the park and were buggered when they got back to London. We couldn't even break them down and get a goal at home. That aint good, I didn't think the team selection was that bad today. But seriously this was a must win for us. Arsenal were depleted, we are at home. Why would we not go in with two strikers. Sherwood always said he'd go for it. But he is playing like a man who doesn't want to get thumped.<br />\n<br />\nToday there were countless times we got the ball to the by-line cut it back and their was no one in the box. If Chadli is going to play that number 10 role he has to be more prevalent in the box. I just felt he was dropping too deep and not helping adebayor. Adebayor really needed the help and was just not getting it. The other thing is why Sherwood is making his subs so late. What is the point in making the subs in the 80th minute. Why take off Chadli, Erikson, Sandro and Put on Siggy and Paulinho. We are chasing a game we need creativity. Take off Chadli and put Soldado up front with Ade. If i had missed the subs i would never have known he made three subs, they were truly ineffective and we became very easy to predict. <br />\n<br />\nOn the plus side. I think Naughton had a good game, Defensively i think he's better than Walker on the right. Obviously not quite up there in attack but i think he keeps a level head a bit better than Walker. Rose also did a good job, people keep talking about the final product but who was there to pass to. 1 attacker in the box and 4 defenders. Your just never going to pick out your player. <br />\nTownsend is a funny one, he gets himself into some awesome positions but then almost tries to hard. Some of the balls he crossed just didn't need to be hit that hard. Just pass it to the players fit dont blast it across goal.<br />\n<br />\nI don't really know what to make of Chadli, i think two upfront is just hands down a better option for a team who are struggling so much to put the ball in the net. this 4-3-3 stuff is so heavily reliant on the wingers being absolute class, and having the knowledge to support the striker in the box. Our wingers just dont look threatening in the box. Half the time i'm gobsmacked at how many of spurs players are not making that final run to the far post or just hanging around the top of the box. Like make a ****ing run, take a chance. At the very least it forces one of the defenders to not concentrate soley on ade. <br />\n<br />\nI dunno thats my thoughts, i think pretty well everyone can see after playing over 3 quarters of the season with a 4-3-3. It is not suiting us at home. Maybe away but at home two strikers up front is imperative from the start. <b>And for the sake of my own sanity, when we are behind in a game stop taking off creative players and putting on players who can close out a game. When we are ahead put on defensive players. For me though TS is so far out of his depth it aint funny. </b>I'm all for giving manager's a chance and all. But i think the hallmark of a good manager is their ability to change the game with subs. Can't really remember an effective sub TS has made in 4 months.[/QUOTE]<br />\n<br />\nbrilliant summed up article and spot on. I just wish Timmy and the players are listening."

Chadli missed a couple of great chances also made some poor decisions in the final third. Adebayor the same. They could have scored a couple on another day too. We  had no organization in the middle of the park. We made nearly 60 clearances inside the box. Yes as i said before the game i don't care how we won but that does not mean with better finishing it would have been a convincing win. With better finishing on their end they could have scored at-least as much as we did."
