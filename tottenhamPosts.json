        "content": "[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6536_zps5237fa24.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n<b>Tottenham Hotspur host Arsenal at White Hart Lane on Sunday 16th March 2014 (KO 16:00) in the 30th match of the 2013-14 Premier League season.</b><br />\n<br />\nSpurs come into the game in 5th place in the Table on 53 points with Arsenal in 3rd on 59 points. This will be the 254th time the two teams have met.<br />\n<br />\nSpurs v Arsenal is now one of the great rivalries in World Football but the fixture had very different beginnings back in November 1887 when the clubs first met in a friendly played on Tottenham Marshes. Arsenal, then called Royal Arsenal, had been formed just a year earlier as Dial Square and were essentially the works team for the munitions factory situated in Woolwich, Kent, while Spurs who had been formed some five years earlier in 1882 still had many of the youngsters who founded the club playing for them. Spurs won that first encounter 2-1, although the game was cut short by 15 minutes, due to poor light conditions because of the Arsenal team getting lost and turning-up late for the start.<br />\n<br />\nSeven more friendlies were played between the two clubs from 1888 to 1896 with Spurs winning four and Arsenal winning three before their first competitive match in March 1899. By this time, Arsenal were re-named Woolwich Arsenal and the clubs met in the United League with the Gunners winning 2-1 at the Manor Ground in Plumstead while Spurs won the return match 3-2 at Northumberland Park.<br />\n<br />\nTwo matches were played within the same week in April 1900 in the Southern District Combination League with Spurs winning 4-2 at White Hart Lane which was followed by a 2-1 win to Arsenal at Plumstead in a game abandoned after 75 minutes due to &quot;bad language&quot;. History doesn't provide the answer as to who was the guilty party! From 1901 to 1920, the clubs met in various minor competitions, friendlies and matches played during the First World War.<br />\n<br />\nTottenham Hotspur joined the Football League in season 1908-09 and won promotion to the First Division on their first attempt. The following season they played Arsenal in December 1909 and lost 0-1 at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, while the reverse fixture at White Hart Lane ended in a 1-1 draw with John Curtis scoring Spurs' first League goal against the Gunners.<br />\n<br />\nThe teams met for three more seasons before Arsenal's relegation at the end of the 1912-13 season with Spurs winning three matches, Arsenal winning two and one game drawn.<br />\n<br />\nSeptember 1913 proved to be a hugely important date in the history of both clubs as Arsenal controversially moved from south of the River Thames into the territory reserved for Tottenham Hotspur and Clapton (later Leyton) Orient, in clear violation of the rules and regulations governing such relocations as stipulated by the Football League. Despite bitter protests, Arsenal's move to Highbury (more correctly called Arsenal Stadium) was allowed.<br />\n<br />\nWhite Hart Lane was requisitioned by the Army during WWI, so Spurs played many of their wartime matches at Highbury.<br />\n<br />\nWhen League football resumed after the war in 1919, it was decided to once again expand the First Division from 20 teams to 22. The normal way of doing this had always been to add the top two clubs from the Second Division to those who were already in the First Division. However, there were complications arising from allegations of match-fixing from Liverpool and Manchester United during the final matches of the last season played before the League was suspended and it was felt that they would forfit their Top Flight status as a result.<br />\n<br />\nFrom nowhere, Arsenal, who had finished sixth (later corrected to fifth) in the Second Division before the war were 'elected' to take Tottenham Hotspur's place in the First Division. Allegations of bribery persist to this day and Henry Norris (Arsenal's Chairman) was later given a lifetime ban from football from the Football League for underhand financial activities.<br />\n<br />\nSpurs and Arsenal played their first Football League match after World War One in the First Division in January 1921 with Spurs winning 2-1 at White Hart Lane while Arsenal won the return match at Highbury 3-2. All 150 League games played to date have taken place in the Top Flight of English football.<br />\n<br />\nHighbury was taken over by the Army during the Second World War and Spurs returned the favour by allowing Arsenal to play their wartime matches at White Hart Lane. Arsenal won the first FA Cup meeting between the two teams 3-0 in the 3rd Round in January 1949. The clubs have played five FA Cup matches to date with Spurs winning two and Arsenal winning three.<br />\n<br />\nThe first Football League Cup match took place in November 1968 with Arsenal winning the first leg of the Semi-Final 1-0 at Highbury and Spurs drawing 1-1 at White Hart Lane the following month. Of the 12 League Cup matches played so far, Spurs have won 3, Arsenal have won 6 and three games have been drawn.<br />\n<br />\nBoth Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur were founder members of the Premier League in season 1992-93 and both clubs are among the seven (Liverpool, Everton, Chelsea, Manchester United and Aston Villa are the other five) who have been ever-present during the 21 seasons of the competition.<br />\n<br />\nArsenal went two goals ahead by halftime in the 2010-11 fixture at the Emirates in November through Samir Nasri and Marouane Chamakh but Spurs came back strongly with goals from Gareth Bale, Rafael van der Vaart (penalty) and Younes Kaboul to secure a 3-2 win.<br />\n<br />\nThe match at White Hart Lane in April 2011 was a six goal thriller with honours even. Theo Walcott and Rafael van der Vaart scored goals within the first 10 minutes before Samir Nasri put the Gunners 2-1 up after 12 minutes. Arsenal went further ahead with a Robin van Persie goal on 40 minutes but Tom Huddlestone made it 2-3 by halftime. Van der Vaart scored the only goal in the second half from the penalty spot.<br />\n<br />\nThe fixture at White Hart Lane in October 2011 was won by Spurs 2-1 with goals from Rafael van der Vaart and Kyle Walker with Aaron Ramsey scoring for Arsenal. The Gunners won their home match in February 2012 5-2. Louis Saha had put Spurs ahead after 4 minutes and an Emmanuel Adebayor penalty put Tottenham further ahead after 34 minutes. But Arsenal pulled two goals back before half-time through Bacary Sagna and Robin van Persie. Tomas Rosicky put Arsenal in front just after the break and the rout was completed with a brace from Theo Walcott.<br />\n<br />\nDuring the 2012 summer transfer window, Spurs signed former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor from Manchester City after having spent a season on loan.<br />\n<br />\nThe match on 17th November at the Emirates resulted in a 5-2 win for Arsenal. Emmanuel Adebayor put Spurs ahead after 10 minutes but was sent-off eight minutes later for a rash tackle on Santi Cazorla. Arsenal then scored three times to make it 3-1 at halftime - Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and Olivier Giroud  grabbing the goals. Santi Cazorla put Arsenal further ahead on the hour mark but Gareth Bale pulled one back for Spurs before Theo Walcott scored the fifth for Arsenal just before the final whistle.<br />\n<br />\nSpurs won the match at the Lane in March 2013 2-1 with Gareth Bale scoring after 37 minutes and Aaron Lennon adding a second two minutes later. Per Mertesacker pulled a goal back for Arsenal six minutes into the second half.<br />\n<br />\nOlivier Giroud scored in the 23rd minute to give Arsenal the points in the September 2013 Premier League game at the Emirates.<br />\n<br />\nArsenal ran-out 2-0 winners in the FA Cup 3rd Round match played at the Emirates in January 2014 with Santi Cazorla &amp; Tomas Rosicky scoring a goal each.<br />\n<br />\nAs far as Football League / Premier League matches go, three player have both scored nine goals for Spurs against Arsenal - Billy Minter and Bobby Smith.<br />\n<br />\nThree Arsenal players have each scored eight goals against Spurs - Robert Pires, Emmanuel Adebayor and Alan Smith.<br />\n<br />\nThere have been three hat-tricks scored during North London Derbies - Terry Dyson for Spurs and Ted Drake &amp; Alan Sunderland for Arsenal.<br />\n<br />\nJimmy Robertson &amp; Emmanuel Adebayor are the only two players to score for both Spurs &amp; Arsenal in a North London Derby.<br />\n<br />\nArsenal's David O'Leary has played in the most North London Derbies (35) while both Gary Mabbutt &amp; Steve Perryman played 31 games with Spurs.<br />\n<br />\nOverall, Spurs have won 91 of the 253 matches played against Arsenal with the Gunners winning 103 and 59 matches drawn.<br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6535_zps5e9efb40.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n<b>[URL=&quot;http://www.myfootballfacts.com/SpursvArsenal.html&quot;]Full History of Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal Matches 1887-2014[/url]</b><br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6537_zps453a29ac.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n<b>They Played for Spurs &amp; Arsenal....</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>Emmanuel Adebayor<br />\nClive Allen</b><br />\nCharlie Ambler<br />\nBob Arber (Arsenal player, Spurs reserves manager)<br />\n<b>David Bentley</b><br />\nDavid Black<br />\n<b>Anton Blackwood</b><br />\nJimmy Brain<br />\n<b>Laurie Brown</b><br />\nWalter Bugg<br />\nLycurgus Burrows<br />\n<b>Sol Campbell</b><br />\nHerbert Chapman (Spurs player, Arsenal manager)<br />\nDamien Comolli (Director of Football at both clubs)<br />\nFreddie Cox<br />\nJames Delvin<br />\nWilf Dixon (Spurs assistant manager, Arsenal trainer)<br />\nJack Eggett<br />\nTom Fitchie<br />\nTheo Foley (Arsenal assistant manager, Spurs reserves manager)<br />\n<b>William Gallas<br />\nGeorge Graham</b> (Arsenal player, manager of both clubs)<br />\n<b>Vic Groves</b><br />\nTom Hatfield<br />\nStewart Houston (Assistant manager at both clubs)<br />\nJoe Hulme (Arsenal player, Spurs manager)<br />\nGeorge Hunt<br />\n<b>David Jenkins<br />\nPat Jennings</b><br />\nBill Julian<br />\nPeter Kyle<br />\nNeil Lacy<br />\nBill Lane (Spurs player, Arsenal scout)<br />\nPeter McWilliam (Spurs manager, Arsenal scout)<br />\nTom Meade<br />\nBilly Minter<br />\n<b>Terry Naylor<br />\nTerry Neill</b> (Arsenal player, manager of both clubs)<br />\n<b>Jamie O'Hara</b><br />\nTom O'Shea<br />\nGeorge Payne<br />\nRon Piper<br />\nTom Pratt<br />\n<b>Rohan Ricketts<br />\nJimmy Robertson</b><br />\nAndrew Swan<br />\nWalter Thomas<br />\nErik Thorstvedt<br />\n<b>Steve Walford</b><br />\nErnie Walley (Spurs player, Arsenal coach)<br />\nCharlie Williams<br />\n<b>Willie Young</b><br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A1805_zpsf0a6bc72.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n<b>[URL=&quot;http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Tottenham_Hotspur_Squad_Numbers.html&quot;]Tottenham Hotspur Premier League Player's Squad Numbers 1993-94 to 2013-14[/url]</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>[URL=&quot;http://www.myfootballfacts.com/Arsenal_Squad_Numbers.html&quot;]Arsenal Premier League Player's Squad Numbers 1993-94 to 2013-14[/url]</b><br />\n<br />\n<b>[URL=&quot;http://www.myfootballfacts.com/London_Derbies_2013-14.html&quot;]Premier League London Derbies Season 2013-14[/url]</b><br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6542_zps5824268a.jpg[/IMG]<br />\n<br />\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v239/jyarden/2013/A6543_zps8c41664b.jpg[/IMG]"

        "content": "Well its do or die! Anything less than a win wil surely be the end of our top 4 hopes. Im sure plenty of people have given up already but if we can somehow muster a victory in this all important game, gain some momentum and some key players back and rediscover the form we had when Sherwood first took over, who knows. Back to back wins against Southampton and Arsenal coupled with back to back loses against us and Chelsea for the gunners, I tell you now, thingsw will start to get very interesting around here. Big ifs but for it all to happen the way we want it to happen we need to beat the scum this weekend.<br />\n<br />\nBoth teams are injury hit but you have got to think we are the slightly better off with arsenal missing wilshere, ramsay,  ozil, walcott and both of their left backs. Say what you want about our form and theirs.....this is the derby, the form book goes out the window and its who wants it the most. Huge stakes to play for for both teams in this one, this game evokes memories of our 2009/10 clash. <br />\n<br />\nWalker and Sandro are both doubts but Ive got to think if there is any chance either will play in this one, they will. No point in looking forward, there will be 2/3rds of fuk all to play for if we come up short.<br />\n<br />\nI just want to see a team sheet before the game that gives me confidence.  Something like this....<br />\n<br />\nLloris<br />\nWalker, Kaboul, Vertonghen, Rose<br />\nSandro<br />\nLennon, Dembele, Eriksen, Townsend<br />\nAdebayor<br />\n<br />\nNo two strikers, Eriksen in a central position,  real wingers, fullbacks playing on their proper sides, no love childs (Bentaleb) and a team of commited footballers who look as though they want to play for the jersey. Please Tim, do us and your job prospects a favour and heed my advice. <br />\n<br />\nTo Dare is to Do!!!<br />\n<br />\nCOYS"

My other current fear is Sandro, since he's been back and especially watching him first hand at Chelsea and last night on TV, he just seems to tear around the pitch mis-timing tackles. If we suffer another sending off in this game I fear an onslaught.<br />\n<br />\nPlease god just win this one, don't care how, who with or how many.[/QUOTE]<br />\n<br />\nSandro is the least of our problems, we need players who can fight. Against Benfica Sandro only got booked because he had no other choice, Eriksen took such a bad free kick that we almost conceded on the break. With a few more minutes his tackling will be back to normal. Most important thing in this game is that we keep a clean sheet, I expect Bentaleb will come in to partner Sandro if Dembele doesn't make it, he was one of our only decent players against Chelsea.<br />\n<br />\nBeing realistic we should accept that there isn't much more these players can do. Some of them are carrying knocks, some of them haven't adjusted to the league, some of them are only just back from lengthy injuries, some missed pre-season, some haven't adapted to the change in manager, there are so many things working against us at the moment. We need to keep working hard with an eye on making a real challenge for the top 4 next season. It's March and we still don't know our best XI, that is the biggest difference between us and the current top 4. We have no idea what our best team is and as a result no real understanding has developed on the pitch."

Paulinho is better against mid or low placed league sides where he has more license to get forward. This is definitley not the game for him to start in a deeper position.<br />\nIr Rose isn't fit, then for fcks sake lets just play Fryers there, not Naughton and keep Jan in his preferred position.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, the only really thing that will make me want to smash things up if it doesn't happen, is if Eriksen doesn't start behind the striker. Every man and his dog that has half a functional brain can see this is where he should play, just please do it Tim.<br />\n<br />\nI'm pretty much done for this season, I just hope we can salvage some pride in this game. Even if we win, i can't see us getting 4th. They will drop more points but doubt it will be enough as so will we. The only thing keeping me optimistic for this game is that we are so bad at the moment and I fully expect them to win, and the reason for that is that football is a funny old game and on so many occasions a surprise pops up when you least expect it.

I'm hoping for the draw personally in your game and I pretty much agree with you on Kusk, great player. Shame my club didn't get him in January. I have a lot of respect for what AaB have done the last couple of years, you have a lot of good young players coming through. <br />\n<br />\nCOYS  and Super Vestegnen, lol. By the way I think Ajax would be the perfect destination for Kusk for now.<br />\n<br />\nEdit: I went up to Aalborg for the game against you lot earlier. The game that changed our season for the better eventhough the loss was just about unbearable to handle. One of my worst aways to this day, it was horrible."

I hope that they will play it on the floor and play through the middle and don't just hoof it up to then to get it coming right back at us. We have to win today to keep in the top 4 hunt. Arsenal have Chelsea next and Chelsea will want to put that result from yesterday right on Saturday. This could be the time for Arsenals league title hopes over."

The dude can't play football, just throws himself at the opposition and gives away fouls in dangerous areas.

Though when fit I think Sandro offers something and can be very useful. However, he's been fit so rarely in his Spurs career. A player needs 10 games to get properly match fit and Sandro is one of those players that struggles to do that. I like the the guy, but if he were to be sold, I'd want us to sign a more technical footballer to replace him. From now on, no matter what their role in the team is, everyone we sign should be comfortable on the ball and be able to pass it around at a high tempo."

There is no point trying to suggest players who are barely match fit like Sando (he ran like he had weights on his ankles in recent weeks) and Kaboul would get anywhere near their team. Maybe if they'd been playing regularly and were at their best, but not even close now. And Verts simply doesn't deserve to be ahead of their CB's. <br />\n<br />\nSo, whilst I agree they are nothing special, I think we need to start accepting how average many of our players are.

Until that nut is cracked ... it's just madness. Besides, Sandro was doing a job for us. I'd continue, but fcuk it, the **** isn't worth it. No, we played well despite Sherwood.

End of......<br />\n<br />\nThe effort was outstanding today but once again we failed to score the goals we needed. I dont blame the players, we simply dont have the chemistry that a team like arsenal have. Thats down to the fact we are so unstable as a team. We've had two managers, new players, inconsistent team selections and formations and a tonne of injuries which ultimately means we have fuk all cohesiveness.  This team  needs a preseason and it needs it now.<br />\n<br />\nNot to worry, the season is gone now.

So either it's the manager's plan that's lacking or the manager has a fan-oh-tastic plan that the players aren't managing to put to life. We are not scoring goals, and we're generally hardly creating clear cut chances or sometimes we even struggle to string three passes together against mediocre opposition. I mean our goal difference is pathetic and while it's been a tad better under Tim it's still pretty awful and we're about as entertaining to look at as rain.<br />\n<br />\nToday we at least played well and it's nearly a miracle that we didn't get two-three goals, and yet another miracle that we only conceded once.

Rose did well on the other side in the first half, but final ball is terrible. The high line was suicidal with no pressure for opening half hour but with an increase in tempo we saw the benefits of this system as it pinned them back. Unfortunately they kinda put backs to the wall in second half, closing up the space available in the first half and forcing us to use possession effectively, a fault of ours all season. Eriksen didn't really affect the game from the left but to me the subs were pointless. Straight swap Sandro for Pauly I understand. Siggy though has little impact barring goals which he wasnt in a position to get most of the time. Soldado perhaps should have been introduced earlier but not for eriksen, as with a front two and a midfield pairing of Paulinho/Bentaleb we simply couldnt create good chances and ultimately ran out of steam. Thats my lot."

        "content": "We obviously played better today. But let's be honest here Arsenal were pretty well missing half there first choice midfield and from what i gathered. Bayern Munich ran them off the park and were buggered when they got back to London. We couldn't even break them down and get a goal at home. That aint good, I didn't think the team selection was that bad today. But seriously this was a must win for us. Arsenal were depleted, we are at home. Why would we not go in with two strikers. Sherwood always said he'd go for it. But he is playing like a man who doesn't want to get thumped.<br />\n<br />\nToday there were countless times we got the ball to the by-line cut it back and their was no one in the box. If Chadli is going to play that number 10 role he has to be more prevalent in the box. I just felt he was dropping too deep and not helping adebayor. Adebayor really needed the help and was just not getting it. The other thing is why Sherwood is making his subs so late. What is the point in making the subs in the 80th minute. Why take off Chadli, Erikson, Sandro and Put on Siggy and Paulinho. We are chasing a game we need creativity. Take off Chadli and put Soldado up front with Ade. If i had missed the subs i would never have known he made three subs, they were truly ineffective and we became very easy to predict. <br />\n<br />\nOn the plus side. I think Naughton had a good game, Defensively i think he's better than Walker on the right. Obviously not quite up there in attack but i think he keeps a level head a bit better than Walker. Rose also did a good job, people keep talking about the final product but who was there to pass to. 1 attacker in the box and 4 defenders. Your just never going to pick out your player. <br />\nTownsend is a funny one, he gets himself into some awesome positions but then almost tries to hard. Some of the balls he crossed just didn't need to be hit that hard. Just pass it to the players fit dont blast it across goal.<br />\n<br />\nI don't really know what to make of Chadli, i think two upfront is just hands down a better option for a team who are struggling so much to put the ball in the net. this 4-3-3 stuff is so heavily reliant on the wingers being absolute class, and having the knowledge to support the striker in the box. Our wingers just dont look threatening in the box. Half the time i'm gobsmacked at how many of spurs players are not making that final run to the far post or just hanging around the top of the box. Like make a ****ing run, take a chance. At the very least it forces one of the defenders to not concentrate soley on ade. <br />\n<br />\nI dunno thats my thoughts, i think pretty well everyone can see after playing over 3 quarters of the season with a 4-3-3. It is not suiting us at home. Maybe away but at home two strikers up front is imperative from the start. <b>And for the sake of my own sanity, when we are behind in a game stop taking off creative players and putting on players who can close out a game. When we are ahead put on defensive players. For me though TS is so far out of his depth it aint funny. </b>I'm all for giving manager's a chance and all. But i think the hallmark of a good manager is their ability to change the game with subs. Can't really remember an effective sub TS has made in 4 months."

Soldado should have come on early when we was going all out against them and given him 30 mins he has the most assists in the prem this year. But instead Sherwood gives him 10 mins to make an impact. At 60 mins it was the perfect time to maybe take Bentaleb off and bring on an attacking player and went all out for the win or the minimum the draw. Sherwoods logic is mind blowing in what he sees and everyone else sees to try to change the game."

However, he has such little help down the left when Eriksen is there. Eriksen naturally and rightly floats into the centre of the pitch leaving rose to cover two players. Then if Rose pushes up on their right back it means Jan has to come across to the left midfielder exposing a hole in the heart of our defence.<br />\n<br />\nNo fault of the players, the fault lies at not having a natural left winger who fully understands the role rather than a makeshift winger using a central midfielder - something that hasn't been addressed since Bale moved into the CAM role middle of last season.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nSent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

        "content": "That game summed up perfectly our current troubles; we had most of the possession, we had most shots on goal and we spent vastly the most amount of time in arse's half. Yet we were impotent. Arse had more shots on target than we did and the clearest chances, despite being on the back foot most of the game and despite missing many good players. We just huffed and puffed without effect for most of the game. We enjoyed a new manager bounce for a bit but that's now evaporated and this could have been a late avb performance.<br />\nWe need even a weakened arse's creativity and we need speed, we're too ploddy and predictable in our approach play and defensively we look likely to concede every time. Ade spend too much time deep coming for the ball or out on the wings and only seems to go upfront when we start playing like Wimbledon and hoofing long balls from the back. Not surprisingly the lads lack confidence which isn't helping but were too predictable. Likely TS will be gone once this forgettable season ends, we need a fresh start with an experienced coach who can take us forward rather than sideways. We need to study the Liverpool model and accept a season or two of building with a PROVEN coach No more cheapskate gambles Mr Levy. Let's get it right next time, no more gambles."

But let's be honest here Arsenal were pretty well missing half there first choice midfield and from what i gathered. Bayern Munich ran them off the park and were buggered when they got back to London. We couldn't even break them down and get a goal at home. That aint good, I didn't think the team selection was that bad today. But seriously this was a must win for us. Arsenal were depleted, we are at home. Why would we not go in with two strikers. Sherwood always said he'd go for it. But he is playing like a man who doesn't want to get thumped.<br />\n<br />\nToday there were countless times we got the ball to the by-line cut it back and their was no one in the box. If Chadli is going to play that number 10 role he has to be more prevalent in the box. I just felt he was dropping too deep and not helping adebayor. Adebayor really needed the help and was just not getting it. The other thing is why Sherwood is making his subs so late. What is the point in making the subs in the 80th minute. Why take off Chadli, Erikson, Sandro and Put on Siggy and Paulinho. We are chasing a game we need creativity. Take off Chadli and put Soldado up front with Ade. If i had missed the subs i would never have known he made three subs, they were truly ineffective and we became very easy to predict. <br />\n<br />\nOn the plus side. I think Naughton had a good game, Defensively i think he's better than Walker on the right. Obviously not quite up there in attack but i think he keeps a level head a bit better than Walker. Rose also did a good job, people keep talking about the final product but who was there to pass to. 1 attacker in the box and 4 defenders. Your just never going to pick out your player. <br />\nTownsend is a funny one, he gets himself into some awesome positions but then almost tries to hard. Some of the balls he crossed just didn't need to be hit that hard. Just pass it to the players fit dont blast it across goal.<br />\n<br />\nI don't really know what to make of Chadli, i think two upfront is just hands down a better option for a team who are struggling so much to put the ball in the net. this 4-3-3 stuff is so heavily reliant on the wingers being absolute class, and having the knowledge to support the striker in the box. Our wingers just dont look threatening in the box. Half the time i'm gobsmacked at how many of spurs players are not making that final run to the far post or just hanging around the top of the box. Like make a ****ing run, take a chance. At the very least it forces one of the defenders to not concentrate soley on ade. <br />\n<br />\nI dunno thats my thoughts, i think pretty well everyone can see after playing over 3 quarters of the season with a 4-3-3. It is not suiting us at home. Maybe away but at home two strikers up front is imperative from the start. <b>And for the sake of my own sanity, when we are behind in a game stop taking off creative players and putting on players who can close out a game. When we are ahead put on defensive players. For me though TS is so far out of his depth it aint funny. </b>I'm all for giving manager's a chance and all. But i think the hallmark of a good manager is their ability to change the game with subs. Can't really remember an effective sub TS has made in 4 months.[/QUOTE]<br />\n<br />\nbrilliant summed up article and spot on. I just wish Timmy and the players are listening."
